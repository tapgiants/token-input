## Installation

```
yarn add @tapgiants/token-input
```

## Usage and examples

TBD. In the meantime just check the `src` folder.

## Custom fields

TBD. Refer to fields implementation (see Token, or Autocomplete).

## Development

Link the package from your target project and run `yarn start`. This will start the webpacker watcher.

Once you are satisfied with your changes, use `yarn publish` to push the new version to npmjs.org.
